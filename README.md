# Object_detection_using_YOLO
Developed a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 deep learning models to accurately detect and classify multiple objects in images and live video streams. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fast and accurate object localization and classification.
